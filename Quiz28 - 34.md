Mirrored time number is a number of two digits x and y which if we write like xy:xy or xy:yx we get a valid time in hh:mm. Your task is to print the valid combinations separated by spaces. If no such combination exists print 'NONE'.

Example mirroredTime(n=11) → 11:11 mirroredTime(n=12) → 12:12, 12:21 mirroredTime(n=99) → NONE

## Quiz 34
There are N cities in a row, numbered from 0 to N-1. There are one-way roads going from left to right between cities. For each city, you know where the road starts, or if there is no road (-1). Output the number of cities that can be reached from city 0 using the roads.

that means that city 0 has no roads incoming (of course, the road could only come from the left, but this is the first city), city 1 has one road incoming from city 0, city 2 has incoming roads from city 1, and city 3 doesn't have any roads incoming, so you have to output 2, because we don't count city 0, city 1 can be reached from city zero (0 -> 1), city 2 can also be reached (0 -> 1 -> 2), and city 3 can't be reached from city 0.
