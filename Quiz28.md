Mirrored time number is a number of two digits x and y which if we write like xy:xy or xy:yx we get a valid time in hh:mm. Your task is to print the valid combinations separated by spaces. If no such combination exists print 'NONE'.

Example mirroredTime(n=11) → 11:11 mirroredTime(n=12) → 12:12, 12:21 mirroredTime(n=99) → NONE

[HL] Use OOP in your solution.
