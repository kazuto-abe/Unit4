## Define the terms:

#### IP address
An IP address is a unique address and numerical label that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network. It also allows developing a virtual connection between a destination and a source.

#### IP version 4 and version 6
IPv4 stands for Internet Protocol version 4. It is the underlying technology that makes it possible for us to connect our devices to the web. Whenever a device accesses the Internet, it is assigned a unique, numerical IP address such as 99.48.227.227. To send data from one computer to another through the web, a data packet must be transferred across the network containing the IP addresses of both devices.

IPv6 is the next generation Internet Protocol (IP) address standard intended to supplement and eventually replace IPv4, the protocol many Internet services still use today. Every computer, mobile phone, home automation component, IoT sensor and any other device connected to the Internet needs a numerical IP address to communicate between other devices. The original IP address scheme, called IPv4, is running out of addresses due to its widespread usage from the proliferation of so many connected devices.

#### SSH
SSH, also known as Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol that gives users, particularly system administrators, a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network.


#### SCP
You can use SCP (the scp command) to securely copy files and directories between remote hosts without starting an FTP session or logging into the remote systems explicitly. The scp command uses SSH to transfer data, so it requires a password or passphrase for authentication.

### Terminal commands: 
* LS
The ls command lists files and directories within the file system, and shows detailed information about them. It is a part of the GNU core utilities package which is installed on all Linux distributions.

* CAT
The name of the cat command comes from its functionality to concatenate files. It can read, concatenate, and write file contents to the standard output. If no file is specified or the input file name is specified as a single hyphen (-), it reads from the standard input.
Cat is most commonly used to display the contents of one or multiple text files, combine files by appending one file’s contents to the end of another file, and create new files.

* ECHO
The echo command is one of the most basic and frequently used commands in Linux. The arguments passed to echo are printed to the standard output.
Echo is commonly used in shell scripts to display a message or output the results of other commands.


* CD
The cd (“change directory”) command is used to change the current working directory in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. It is one of the most basic and frequently used commands when working on the Linux terminal.

* CHMOD
In Linux, access to the files is managed through the file permissions, attributes, and ownership. This ensures that only authorized users and processes can access files and directories.


#### Server
A server is a software or hardware device that accepts and responds to requests made over a network. The device that makes the request, and receives a response from the server, is called a client. 

#### Router
The router is a physical or virtual internetworking device that is designed to receive, analyze, and forward data packets between computer networks. 

#### Switch
Switches facilitate the sharing of resources by connecting together all the devices, including computers, printers, and servers, in a small business network.

#### wLAN
Stands for "Wireless Local Area Network." A WLAN, or wireless LAN, is a network that allows devices to connect and communicate wirelessly. Unlike a traditional wired LAN, in which devices communicate over Ethernet cables, devices on a WLAN communicate via Wi-Fi.


#### LAN
A LAN server, or file server, is a specialized, high-speed computer that houses the application programs and files for computers on a network. A network administrator grants user access to apps and files on a LAN server.
