### what did we do?
A couple of physical components are provided in order to create a small network.<br>
By connecting swich and router with the power supply, it successfully spreads internet to the other computers.
At the end, we have created shared-file that everyone who belongs to the same network and exchange them amoung each other, which was totally new hands-on experience for me. Further, this was great opportunity to deepen and apply the knowledge learnt by well-explained videos on Managebac.
